As far as any flaws in the design, I believe the inputs should have some sort of label. Once a user starts typing in an input the placeholder goes away. A user with a cognitive disability could forget what needs to go in the input. Inputs should be designed with forgetfulness in mind. 

Not sure if it is just a spelling error but the contacts link's spelling should match the contact link on the bottom. That is assumng they go to the same place. If not, one should be renamed. The message about the terms and conditions under the form should read differently. 

Also, in the form, it is easy to see where the border for the input overlaps the border for the form.

This was a fun exercise! Thank you for the opportunity!
